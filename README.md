# HeartDiseasePrediction

# Overview
This project focuses on predicting heart disease risk using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various patient health parameters, the system generates a probability of heart disease presence, assisting in early detection and preventive healthcare measures.

# Methodology
1) Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gather patient data, clean inconsistencies, and normalize values for machine learning processing.
2) Model Training: Utilize a supervised learning approach with algorithms like Random Forest.
3) Model Deployment: Load the trained model in a web-based environment for user interaction.
4) User Input & Prediction: Accept user-submitted health attributes, process the data, and predict the likelihood of heart disease.
5) Result Interpretation: Provide easy-to-understand insights based on model predictions.

# Machine Learning Models Used
1)Logistic Regression
2)Naive Bayes
3)Decision Tree
4)Random Forest
5)XGBoost

# How the project works ?
The heart disease prediction system operates through a structured, interactive process designed to assist users in assessing their health status.

1) User Navigation: Upon clicking the "Heart Status" button on the homepage, users are directed to an information page where they are required to enter personal health details such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, thalassemia type, resting electrocardiogram (restecg), and other relevant medical parameters.
2) Health Assessment & Diagnosis: The system processes the provided inputs using a trained machine learning model. If the analysis determines a high likelihood of heart disease, the system notifies the user of the risk and recommends specialized cardiologists for consultation.
3) Preventive Guidance for Healthy Individuals: If the system concludes that the user does not exhibit signs of heart disease, it provides a preventive diet chart and lifestyle recommendations to help maintain heart health and minimize future risks.

This structured approach ensures accurate predictions, timely medical referrals, and proactive healthcare guidance, enhancing overall heart disease prevention and management.

# Conclusion 
After evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms, Random Forest emerges as the most effective model for heart disease prediction due to its ability to handle complex data patterns and prevent overfitting. Its ensemble learning approach enhances accuracy, making it a reliable choice for medical diagnoses.
